### <b> Note about github </b> We used one cloud 9 workspace. So all the pushes / commits show under Honorio's name since he created the repo. However, we all contributed commited files and pushed them to github.


## Project Desciption


### For this project, we decided to make a web app where users can login and chat with one another. We added external apis such as
Getty images for dynamic background images, spotify for our group music player. We also implemented giffy so users can send gifs in chat. 
Think of this as basically the structure for a web based slack clone. There is a bot that the user can interact with. 

## Future work
### We think it'll be cool if we were able to fully implement the youtube serch api with visual results. Also we bounced around the idea
with implementing socketio video chat with the python backend and client side in JS.

## Who worked on what? 
### Javar and Honorio worked on server side, setting up the chat functionality and bot commands, ReactJS, and Spotify integration. 
### Antonio focused more on client side views (CSS). 


#### Note about the file in static/script.js < this file is automatically generated by webpack. it compiles all our js files into one essentially to it can send it to the virtual DOM
