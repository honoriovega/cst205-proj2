# CST-205 - Project 2
## Authors: Javar Alexander, Honorio Vega, Antonio Villagomez

##Project Desciption

###For this project, we decided to make a web app where users can login and chat with one another. We added external apis such as
###Getty images for dynamic background images, spotify for our group music player. We also implemented giffy so users can send gifs in chat. 
###Think of this as basically the structure for a web based slack clone. There is a bot that the user can interact with. 

##Who worked on what? 
###Javar and Honorio worked on server side, setting up the chat functionality and bot commands, and ReactJS. 
###Antonio focused more on client side views (CSS).
